# Introduction
This project aims to analyze subscription sales data provided in a JSON format to derive actionable insights that can impact Nexar's business decisions and productivity. The analysis is divided into two main challenges: cleaning and aggregating the data to extract key sales metrics and proposing meaningful analyses based on the dataset to provide strategic insights.
All data processing and analyses will be conducted using Google BigQuery, a powerful cloud-based platform for managing and analyzing large datasets. BigQuery's scalability and SQL-based querying capabilities make it an ideal choice for this assignment, ensuring efficient and accurate data handling.
The project deliverables include:
1. A cleaned and processed dataset with monthly subscription sales figures.
2. Proposed analyses, including one detailed analysis with results and insights.
3. Visualizations created using Looker Studio, leveraging BigQuery as the data source.
This structured approach will ensure clarity, accuracy, and actionable results, showcasing critical thinking, data-handling skills, and alignment with Nexarâ€™s culture of data-driven decision-making.
